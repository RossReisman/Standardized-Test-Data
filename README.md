#Project 1: Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference

### Overview

For this project, we're going to take a look at SAT and ACT scores and participation rates around the United States for the class of 2017. The prompt for this project was to recommend to the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - how to improve the participation rate of its exams. 


### Motivation

This is a simple Data Analysis project that showcases my basic ability to perform EDA, data visualization, and make a real world business recommendation.

Additionally, this was the first project from my Data Science Immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly. (Hence the prompts)
